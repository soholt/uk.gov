## Earning £35-70k

From the [advise](#) received, it is very clear that the public servant is abusing the law.
Lewisham Council seem to be very crafty bunch, therefore I conclude that if an officer was not up to the requirements for the job, he/she would not be employed. Nobody gets paid £35k+ for not knowing the law, so, moving goalposts, psychological pressure, abuse and discrimination is evident.

Mr John Barker, Housing Options and Advice Service Manager, was forwarded the s184 response and he seem to agree with Prevention and Support Officer Mr Timothy Odofin
